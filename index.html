<h1><b> World Hunger</b></h1>
<p>Poverty-stricken people and families might go without proper housing, clean water, healthy food,
  and medical attention. ) is the main reason why the world is facing extreme hunger.
  Millions live with hunger and malnourishment because they simply cannot afford to buy enough food, cannot afford
  nutritious foods or cannot afford the farming supplies they need to grow enough good food of their own. Hunger can be
  viewed as a dimension of extreme poverty. .Nearly one in ten people around the world go to bed hungry each night, a
  crisis driven largely by conflict, climate change, and chronic inequality .More than 99 million children under age
  five are still undernourished and underweight. </p>
